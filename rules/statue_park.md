# Statue Park

Statue Park puzzles are played on a grid which can feature black and white circles. They always come with a list of pieces (usually tetrominos or pentominos), and an instruction as to reflections and/or rotations. Pieces are often labelled by letters for ease of identification.

The following puzzle allows both rotations and reflections.
